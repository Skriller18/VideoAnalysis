Speaker SPEAKER_00:  What did you do, Murph? She didn't do nothing. Murph, he's long.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  You're a well-educated man, Coop. And a trained pilot. And an engineer.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  The world doesn't need any more engineers.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  We didn't run out of planes and television sets.

Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Dan, why did you name me after something that's bad? Oh, we did.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  Oh, we didn't. Murphy's Law. Murphy's Law doesn't mean that something bad will happen.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  It means that whatever can happen will happen.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  We must confront the reality that nothing in our Solar System
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  can help us. Now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  They're not meant to save the world.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  We're meant to leave it.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  And this is the mission you were trained for. I've got kids, Professor. Get out there and save them.
Speaker SPEAKER_00:  You have no idea when you're coming back.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  We must reach far beyond our own life spares.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  We must think, not as individuals.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  but as a species.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  we must confront the reality.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  of interstellar travel.
Speaker SPEAKER_01:  Mark, I love you. Forever.
